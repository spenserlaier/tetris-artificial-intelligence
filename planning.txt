how should pieces be represented?

the current piece should probably be represented as a series
of positions which can then be adjusted (rotated), assuming that the
positional adjustments don't cause overlap with the pre-existing pieces
or the board itself

if the piece reaches a point where any of its bototmmost surfaces 
are in contact with either the board itself or another placed piece,
then that piece needs to be set in its current position and become a part
of the board

after a piece has been placed, while the any row is full, remove it
and adjust the positions of all rows above it downwards by one


if the position of a portion of a new piece overlaps with any existing piece, then the game is over
